To demonstrate the effectiveness of the QRNN
models, we present the results of past and cur-
rent state-of-the-art neural language models in Ta-
ble 1; we report the Skip- and AWD-LSTM re-
sults as seen in the original papers, while we re-
port our QRNN results. Skip LSTM denotes the
four-layer Skip LSTM in Melis et al. (2018). Rae
et al. (2018) focus on Hebbian softmax, a model
extension technique—Rae-LSTM refers to their
base LSTM model without any extensions. In our
