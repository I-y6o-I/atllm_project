AWD-LSTM. Merity et al. (2018b) show that a
simple three-layer LSTM, with proper regulariza-
tion and optimization techniques, can achieve state
of the art on various language modeling datasets,
surpassing more complex models. Speciﬁcally,
Merity et al. (2018b) apply randomized backprop-
agation through time, variational dropout, activa-
tion regularization, embedding dropout, and tem-
poral activation regularization. A novel sched-
