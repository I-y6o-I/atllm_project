question classiﬁcation (TREC), entailment classiﬁcation (SNLI, SciTail), answer
selection (WikiQA, TrecQA) and reading comprehension (NarrativeQA). Across all
26 datasets, our results demonstrate that RCRN not only consistently outperforms
BiLSTMs but also stacked BiLSTMs, suggesting that our controller architecture
might be a suitable replacement for the widely adopted stacked architecture.
1 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) live at the heart of many sequence modeling problems. In
