(RCRN) for expressive and powerful sequence encoding. More concretely, the key
idea behind our approach is to learn the recurrent gating functions using recurrent
networks. Our architecture is split into two components - a controller cell and a
listener cell whereby the recurrent controller actively inﬂuences the compositional-
ity of the listener cell. We conduct extensive experiments on a myriad of tasks in
the NLP domain such as sentiment analysis (SST, IMDb, Amazon reviews, etc.),
